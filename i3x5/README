This document gives some of the relevant details related to the 3x5 card
project.

Project Name:
3x5 Cards

Purpose:
The 3x5 Cards project provides an intuitive web interface to a
database.  The metaphor is the 3"x5" index card.
Each card has a number, a title, and the contents of the card itself.
The cards can be arranged by either the number or the title, and
can be collected in batches.  Unlike the 3"x5" index card ... the
3x5 card can exist in multiple batches, and the characteristics
of batches can be related together.

Access can be granted, through a password mechanism, to allow
full administrative access, writing and creating cards,
appending information to existing cards only, or the most
restrictive of read-only.

Requires:
	Apache		- web server
	PHP4		- embedded scripting and display
	Postgres 7.x	- database
		(with plpgsql - Postgres procedural language - for triggers)


Principle Author:	R.K. Owen, Ph.D.
