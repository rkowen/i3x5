This document gives some of the relevant details related to the 3x5 card
project.

Project Name:
3x5 Cards

Purpose:
The 3x5 Cards project provides an intuitive web interface to a
database.  The metaphor is the 3"x5" index card.
Each card has a number, a title, and the contents of the card itself.
The cards can be arranged by either the number or the title, and
can be collected in batches.  Unlike the 3"x5" index card ... the
3x5 card can exist in multiple batches, and the characteristics
of batches can be related together.

Access can be granted, through a password mechanism, to allow
full administrative access, writing and creating cards,
appending information to existing cards only, or the most
restrictive of read-only.

Requires:
	Apache		- web server
	PHP4		- embedded scripting and display
	Postgres 7.x	- database
		(with plpgsql - Postgres procedural language - for triggers)


Principle Author:	R.K. Owen, Ph.D.
Initial Date:		05/12/2002

The current version number is given in the cards.inc file.
All configurable color and site values are given in cards.inc .


INSTALLATION:
Apache -
Should be running as user/group "nobody", but some out-of-the-box
distributions (such as RedHat 7.2) have it set to user/group "apache".
This can be changed by editing the httpd.conf and editing it to:
	User nobody
	Group nobody

Or if this is not feasible then edit the 3x5.sql file replacing
"nobody" with whatever user the httpd daemon runs as.

Postgres -
Needs the procedural language to be loaded, which is not loaded
by default.  If you use the >7.2 rpms, then just do the following command:
	createlang plpgsql template1
else read src/pl/plpgsql/src/INSTALL in the PostgreSQL sources for further
info.

Create the database with (must be a user that can do this ... if
not as yourself, then as the postgres user.)
	createdb i3x5

Create a user "nobody", the default user the httpd daemon user,
which will be given access to the i3x5 schema:
	createuser -D -A nobody

Create tables by starting the PostgreSQL interactive terminal
and invoking the sql scripts.  The prompt is given as "i3x5=#".
	psql i3x5
	i3x5=# \i 3x5.sql	(ignore the errors if starting from scratch)
	i3x5=# \i 3x5_help.sql
	i3x5=# \q
