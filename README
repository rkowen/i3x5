This document gives some of the relevant details related to the 3x5 card
project.

Project Name:
3x5 Cards

Purpose:
The 3x5 Cards project provides an intuitive web interface to a
database.  The metaphor is the 3"x5" index card.
Each card has a number, a title, and the contents of the card itself.
The cards can be arranged by either the number or the title, and
can be collected in batches.  Unlike the 3"x5" index card ... the
3x5 card can exist in multiple batches, and the characteristics
of batches can be related together.

Access can be granted, through a password mechanism, to allow
full administrative access, writing and creating cards,
appending information to existing cards only, or the most
restrictive of read-only.

Requires:
	Apache2		- web server
	PHP7		- embedded scripting and display
	Postgres 10.x	- database
		(with plpgsql - Postgres procedural language - for triggers)


Principle Author:	R.K. Owen, Ph.D.
Initial Date:		05/12/2002

The current version number is given in the cards.inc file.
All configurable color and site values are given in cards.inc .


INSTALLATION:
Apache2 -
Should be running as user/group "www-data" or the equivalent non-privileged
user/group, The Ubuntu distribution uses "www-data".
The user/group is defined in apache2/envvars.

This can be changed by editing the envvars or apache2.conf and editing it to:
	User www-data
	Group www-data

Or if this is not feasible then edit the 3x5.sql file replacing
"www-data" with whatever user the httpd daemon runs as.

Postgres -
Needs the procedural language to be loaded, which is now loaded by default.
Check by executing psql and giving \dL at the prompt.  Should see
plpgsql in the list.

Older versions of Postgres required installing the PL/PostgreSQL
procedural language manually with something like:
	createlang plpgsql template1
Read src/pl/plpgsql/src/INSTALL in the PostgreSQL sources for further
info.

Create the database with (must be a user that can do this ... if
not as yourself, then as the postgres user.)
	createdb i3x5

Create a user "www-data", the default user the httpd daemon user,
which will be given access to the i3x5 schema:
	createuser -D -A www-data

Create tables by starting the PostgreSQL interactive terminal
and invoking the sql scripts.  The prompt is given as "i3x5=#".
	psql i3x5
	i3x5=# \i 3x5.sql	(ignore the errors if starting from scratch)
	i3x5=# \i 3x5_help.sql
	i3x5=# \q


PHP5 - 
The configuration options are given here (tailor the path to your own site)

configure \
	--with-apxs --prefix=/php_path/php/7.2 \
	--with-config-file-path=/php_path/php/7.2/lib \
	--with-exec-dir=/php_path/php/7.2/bin --with-openssl \
	--without-pear --enable-xml --enable-wddx \
	--with-pgsql --with-gdbm

Or use packages.  The following are the list for Ubuntu.

php
php-common
php-pgsql

Create a file named db_connect.inc with the following lines
or edit db_connect.template, copy to db_connect.inc changing the
password to whatever you used.
